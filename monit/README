=========================
 Puppet module for monit
=========================

This is a puppet module for monit.  It provides a simple way to install the
package, run the service, and handle the configuration.  It also provides a
separate directory for other packages to install monit snippets.

Usage
=====

How to use the module
---------------------

Add the following to your node manifest::

  $monit_secret="something secret, something safe"
  $monit_alert="someone@example.org"
  include monit

This will add a host-only "/etc/monit/monitrc" configuration file, which in
turn will include any file ending with ".monitrc" in the "/etc/monit/conf.d/"
directory.

Making passwords
----------------

The $monit_secret variable is used to construct a password for your monit
instance.

If you do not set a monit secret, it will use a default "secret" to make
passwords.

How to provide monit configuration snippets?
--------------------------------------------

This module can be used by other modules and classes to monitor their services.

Example::

  monit::check::process{"openssh":
    pidfile     => "/var/run/sshd.pid",
    start       => "/etc/init.d/ssh start",
    stop        => "/etc/init.d/ssh stop",
    customlines => ["if failed port 22 then restart",
                    "if 2 restarts within 3 cycles then timeout"]
  }
