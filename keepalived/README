==============================
 Puppet module for keepalived
==============================

This is a module to install and control keepalived.

Limited functionality
=====================

For the moment, it will just control VRRP instances.  That'll give you IP
address and routing failover between nodes.  No IPVS support is added yet.

Requirements
============

This module requires keepalived version 1.1.14 or higher, to support the
"include" statement.

Example
=======

include keepalived
keepalived::vrrp_instance {

  "vlan101":
    virtual_ipaddress => "192.0.2.1/32";

  "vlan101-foo":
    ensure            => absent,
    interface         => "vlan101",
    virtual_ipaddress => ["192.0.2.2/32",
                          "192.0.2.3/32"];

  "vlan102":
    virtual_ipaddress => ["192.0.2.4/32"],
    virtual_routes    => ["192.0.2.128/30",
                          "192.0.2.132/30 via 102.0.2.130"
                          "unreachable 192.0.2.192/26"];
}
